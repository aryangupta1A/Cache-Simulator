# Cache-Simulator
This was a course project as part of ES 215 Course offered at IIT Gandhinagar. The simulator takes cache size, block size, trace files and associativity as input and outputs plots showing execution time , cache missses and the distribution of instructions types in a seperate window. Also a csv file named " cache_parameters.csv" will be automatically generated in the local D drive showing cache accesses, cache misses, dirty blocks evicted and other parameters. On the console, a conclusive statement will appear telling the best execution time and to what cache organization it corresponds to. 

Procedure to run the simulator:
Download the trace files on your desktop.
Open the 'cache.py' file. On running this file a pop up window will appear which will ask you to select a trace file. You can select from one of the trace files already given or manually input a trace file.
After selecting the trace file dialouge boxes will appear where we will have to enter cache size,block size and associativity.
Now wait for half a minute for simulator to run .
After the program has been run , the plots showing execution time , cache missses and the distribution of instructions type will appear in a seperate window .
Also a csv file named " cache_parameters.csv" will be automatically generated in  the D drive.
On the console, a conclusive statement will appear telling the best execution time and to what cache organization it corresponds to. 
The csv file will have 25 parameters for 10 different types of cache organization .
